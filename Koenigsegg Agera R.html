Koenigsegg Agera R. The Agera R made its debut at the March 2011 Geneva Motor Show—with a Speed Racer livery theme, and special Michelin tyres.<br><br>
The Koenigsegg Agera is a mid-engined sports car produced by Swedish car manufacturer Koenigsegg since 2011. It is a successor to the Koenigsegg CCX/CCXR. The name comes from the Swedish verb 'agera' which means "to act" or in imperative form "(You) act!". <br><br>
The Agera is powered by an in-house developed 5.0-litre twin-turbocharged V8 engine which produces 701 kW (940 hp) at 6900 rpm and 1,100 N·m (810 lb·ft) of torque at 4000 rpm. Total weight of the engine is only 197 kg (434 lb) thanks to a carbon fiber inlet manifold and the aluminium construction.<br><br>
